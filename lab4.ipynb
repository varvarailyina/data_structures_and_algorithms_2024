    "* **Methods**: Functions defined within a class. They operate on the object's attributes and represent the object's behavior.\n",

    "## Modules and packages in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, I gave a very brief refresher on Python modules (files ending in `.py`) and Jupyter notebooks (files ending in `.ipynb`). Let's have another look at modules and packages (this [introduction](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/) on modules and packages is a great resource):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "* any code you write in a Python module can be accessed in other places by `import` statement. E.g. if you have created two files called `mod1.py` and `mod2.py` in your project, and you want to call a function called `foo()` from `mod1.py` in `mod2.py`, you do this by writing one of the following at the top of `mod2.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mod1\n",
    "\n",
    "mod1.foo('something')\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mod1 as m\n",
    "\n",
    "m.foo('something')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mod1 import foo\n",
    "\n",
    "foo('something')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# not recommended\n",
    "from mod1 import * \n",
    "\n",
    "foo('something')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* any Python module can also be run as a Python script (e.g. by running `python mod1.py` in the command line). So that Python knows what to do when a `.py` file is being run as a module or a script, we can add the `if (__name__ == '__main__'):` clause at the end of the file -- everything that should only be run when the `.py` is being treated as a script goes underneath the `if` clause. E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def foo(x):\n",
    "    return f'{x} is fishy'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    print(foo('something REALLY'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(your Python interpreter sets the `__name__` variable of a module to `\"__main__\"` when the code is running in the 'top-level code environment', which is what happens when you run the file as a script)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "* packages are useful when you have developed a larger collection of modules, both for yourself or to share it with others\n",
    "* to create a package, you a specific hierarchical folder structure, namely the package directory (that contains the `.py` files for the package) must sit within the project directory (e.g. `package_name/package_name/codefile1.py`, `package_name/package_name/codefile2.py` etc)\n",
    "* apart from that, the package folder (the lower one in the folder hierarchy) must contain a package initialisation file called `__init__.py` (this can be empty but it needs to be there for the folder to be treated as a package).\n",
    "* other things that may eventually sit inside the root directory of the package (the higher one in the hierarchy) are a tests (or a `tests` folder), documentation, and the `setup.py` file (which contains information on how the package should be built and installed).\n",
    "* if you'd like to create a package in a way that allows you to share it (and for someone else to install it), [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-upload-your-first-python-package-to-pypi/) is a great first place to learn."
