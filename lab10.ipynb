    "\n",
    "Implement a function to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph using Prim's algorithm, as you saw in the lectures. As a refresher, the algorithm works as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a random vertex as the starting point, and include it as the first vertex in the MST.\n",
    "2. Compare the edges going out from the MST. Choose the edge with the lowest weight that connects a vertex among the MST vertices to a vertex outside the MST.\n",
    "3. Add that edge and vertex to the MST.\n",
    "4. Keep doing step 2 and 3 until all vertices belong to the MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You can follow the following steps separately and then put them together in the `prim_algorithm` function in the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialise minimum spanning tree:** Create an empty list to store the edges forming the minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "2. **Initialise visited set:** Create an empty set to keep track of visited vertices (an empty set is initialised by `set()`). Then add the starting vertex to the visited set to mark it as visited.\n",
    "3. **Initialise priority queue:** Create a priority queue (heap, using the heapq package) to store edges incident to visited vertices. Initialise the priority queue with edges incident to the starting vertex. In practice, do this by creating a list of tuples (`pq = [(weight1, starting_vertex, neighbour1),(weight2, starting_vertex, neighbour2), ...]` first, and then use `heapq.heapify(pq)` to turn it into a priority queue.\n",
    "4. **Explore edges:** Use a while loop to iterate until the priority queue is empty. Inside the loop, pop the edge with the minimum weight from the priority queue (using `heapq.heappop(pq)`)\n",
    "5. **Check visited status:** Check if the destination vertex of the popped edge is already visited. If not visited:\n",
    "   - Mark the destination vertex as visited.\n",
    "   - Add the edge to the minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "   - Explore edges incident to the destination vertex.\n",
    "   - Add unvisited incident edges to the priority queue.\n",
    "6. **Return minimum spanning tree:** After visiting all vertices, return the list of edges forming the minimum spanning tree."
