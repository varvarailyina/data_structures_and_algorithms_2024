We know that $P \\subseteq NP$, i.e. class P is contained in NP, because: if a problem can be solved in polynomial time, then one can also verify the solution in polynomial time, just by solving it. In general, it's often easy to show that a problem belongs to NP (find an efficient certifier) but we can't prove that any problem in NP does not also belong to P. One of the big questions in computer science: Is there a problem in NP that does not belong to P? (aka does P=NP?) more commonly believed that P=NP but there is no hard evidence. \n",
