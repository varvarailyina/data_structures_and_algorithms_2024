    "\n",
    "Virtual environments help you isolate the Python (or R) versions and packages that you need for a certain project from those you might need from a different one. When you create a new virtual environment using the `conda create -n env_name ...` command, miniconda automatically creates a new directory with the name you have chosen (in this case it would be `env_name`) inside miniconda's own directory structure. By default, this is in your `Users` folder or equivalent (e.g. for me the path to the new directory in this example would be `/Users/lenamangold/miniconda3/envs/env_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created a virtual environment, you can completely ignore this folder - it's where conda installs Python & packages; **do not** create your project directories **inside** this miniconda folder structure. Instead, keep project directories in your normal folder structure; to use the conda environment (e.g. to run a jupyter notebook or a flask app), run `conda activate env_name` on the command line after having navigated into the desired folder using `cd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebooks vs Python modules (and IDEs)\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks (files with the `.ipynb` extension) are best for code exploration and to display code alongside markdown. While it is possible with some IDEs (e.g. some versions of Pycharm) to run Jupyter notebooks *inside* the IDE, this sometimes doesn't work very well and I would recommend running them from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python modules (files with the `.py` extension) are where you write the functions and classes that will be reused later on (e.g. as part of a data science project or a web app, or even in a Jupyter notebook). IDEs like PyCharm can help you with things like testing, debugging, documenting, and refactoring of your functions and classes."

But they are relatively straightforward to build and they are faster than dynamic websites.\n",
