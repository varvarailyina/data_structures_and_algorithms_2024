Databases are essential components of most software applications, providing a structured way to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. \n",

    "\n",
    "When building a Flask application, using a database instead of hardcoding data or using spreadsheets offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: provide mechanisms to enforce data integrity through constraints and relationships, ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate (e.g. we make sure a certain data type or size is entered).\n",
    "- **Scalability**: designed to handle large volumes of data and concurrent user requests, making them suitable for applications with growing user bases.\n",
    "- **Querying Flexibility**: there is already a language 'built-in' to create complex queries to retrieve, filter, and analyse data based on various criteria.\n",
    "- **Concurrency Control**: mechanisms for managing concurrent access to data, preventing conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a website with a blog: Storing blog posts and related data (user information, ) in a database allows for efficient retrieval, searching, and filtering of posts based on author, category, date, etc. It also facilitates the addition of features such as user comments, likes, and analytics, which would be challenging to implement with hardcoded data or spreadsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Database Structure: Blog Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "For our blog posts situation, a database structure for storing the posts and related data might include the following tables:\n",

    "1. **Posts Table**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| post_id | title           | content                           | author_id | date_posted | category_id |\n",

    "| 2       | Second Post     | Content of the second blog post.  | 2         | 05-03-2024  | 2           |\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Authors Table**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| author_id | name      | email             | bio                            |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Querying the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the database is set up with the above structure, we would normally query it using SQL. For example, to retrieve all blog blog titles along with their authors and categories, we might use the following SQL query:\n",

    "It turns out that to integrate a database into your Flask app, you do not need to know SQL - there are Python library that help you work with databases by using Python classes (rather than having to deal with the database tables directly) (aka in a 'Pythonic' way). \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, to integrate databases into flask apps, we can use a library called `Flask-SQLAlchemy`, based on another popular Python library called `SQLAlchemy`. `SQLAlchemy` is an SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, which allows developers to work with relational databases in the above-mentioned 'Pythonic' way. SQLAlchemy supports various types of SQL databases, including SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others. \n",

    "This last point underlines one of the advantages of Flask: it provides support for integrating various types of databases into web applications and it does not support any single one of them 'natively'. This means that we can choose a database that fits our application: `SQLAlchemy` allows us to switch between databases, without having to change the code in our app or change the way in which we are accessing the database. For example, we might want to start off with an SQLite databae (which does not require a server) and later -- to deploy an application that requires a server -- we could change to MySQL or PostgreSQL. \n",
