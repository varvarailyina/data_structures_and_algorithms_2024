    "Plotly is an interactive plotting library - you can include things like buttons, sliders, dropdowns. It can be easily integrated with flask. Let's first create a simple bar chart as an example (example taken from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946)). You can either add this dashboard page to your own personal flask app (for which you have created your about page) or you can clone [this](https://github.com/lenafm/my_flask_app) repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have cloned the repo, you need to add a `config.py` file (inside the `instance` folder, that you need to create inside the project root directory). The `config.py` file only needs to contain one line of code with a secret key (`SECRET_KEY='some password'`). Then you need to initialise the database in a python shell (run `python` while in the `my_flask_app` project root directory and with your flask environment activated):\n",

    "3. Create a new route to your `routes.py` file, that will display the dashboard html, when the user goes to `/dashboard`. (This is where we will display the dynamic plotly graphs later, which will update for user page loads). Within the dashboard() method, we create the dataframe and create a plot with [plotly express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) (plotly module for the most common figures, e.g. bar charts) that is assigned to the variable `fig`. To include plotly figures in flask, we need to convert the plot to something called JSON format format using the `json.dumps()` and the JSON encoder that comes with Plotly. We do this so that the flask app can use the plotly javascript library to render the plot properly.\n",

    "4. Finally, create a new html template in your templates folder, called `dashboard.html` and add the following content. Here we include our bar chart by specificing a HTML div tag that we need to give some id and we must set its class attrivute to `chart`, for this to work. The script tags include some Javascript into our code. The first script tag imports the plotly javscript library.
