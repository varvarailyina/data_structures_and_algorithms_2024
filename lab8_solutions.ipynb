    "### Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases, making it a more efficient sorting algorithm than, for example, bubble sort. It achieves this time complexity by dividing the array into halves recursively and merging the sorted halves efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this in more detail: remember that for divide-and-conquer algorithms, we use a **recurrence relation** to express the running time. Let's say $T(n)$ is the worst-case running time of the algorithm for an input of size $n$, and at each step we subdivide the problem (in this case into two pieces of size $n/2$). At each step, we then know that the algorithm will spend $T(n/2)$ on each sub-problem plus some amount of time (in this case $O(n)$) on combining the subproblems. The running time of the algorithm therefore satisfies the recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <img src=\"images/screenshot_mergesort.png\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of solving such a recurrence relation (i.e. make $T$ only appear on the left-hand side of the inequality). The most intuitive way is to 'unroll' the recurrence and look at patterns in the first few levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <img src=\"images/screenshot_rectree_mergesort.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "What's going on here? At the top level, we're spennding $n$ iterations (or $cn$, but let's ignore the constant) on the combining part of the algorithm (plus the recursive calls). At the next level, we therefore spend - on each of the two subproblems time at most $n/2$. Since there are two of them, we are again at time $n$. Similarly for the next level. \n",
    "\n",
    "So at level $j$, the number of subproblems has doubled $j$ times, so there are now $2^j$ subproblems. Each has also got smaller by a factor of two $j$ times, so takes time at most $n/(2^j)$. This means that this level $j$ contributes $2^j (n/2^j) = n$ to the running time. Then we need to sum over all the levels. Since the number of times the input was halved to go from $n$ to $2$ is $\\log_2 n$ and we take $n$ at each level, the total running time is $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to use the **Master Theorem**, which helps us analyse the runtime of these types of algorithms in a more general form. First, let's remind ourselves of the way in which the recurrence relation can be written more generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <img src=\"images/screenshot_rec_equation.png\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then establish the general form for the running time $T(n)$, following a similar pattern to the one we looked at for the recursion tree above. To get to the total running time, we have to sum up the time the algorithm spends at every level (and there are $\\log_b n$ levels), which depends on the number and the size of the subproblems (which is what makes up $r$). \n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <img src=\"images/screenshot_mastertheorem.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the this to infer whether an algorithm is root-dominated, leaf-dominated or balanced. For example, in the case where the combining step takes linear time ($c=1$) and dividing into subproblems of size $n/2$, then we have $r=a/2$. For different numbers of subproblems, we then have the following running times (based on the Master Theorem):\n",
    "\n",
    "* a = 1 - running time is linear\n",
    "* a = 2 - running time is O(n log n) (merge sort we looked at above)\n",
    "* a > 2 - running time is polynomial (bound with an exponent larger than 1 that grows with a).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the 'work' is spent on different parts of the recursion: when a = 1, the total running time is dominated by the top level (i.e. at the root, where it is spent on the combining element); when $a > 2$ the running time is dominated by the work done at the leaves (aka on the subproblems at the bottom of the recursion). This becomes clear when you look at the following two recursion trees in addition to the one for case $a=2$ that we saw above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $a=3$, we have:\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <img src=\"images/screenshot_rectree_a3.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
